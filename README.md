I cloned Pinterest website using VITE. I manipulated Unsplash's API to obtain the images. The importance of this project are the following. 
1- Using VITE to be able to create "components" on different files more easily. 
For this project I created 3 components, "IconButton", "NavButton", and "SearchBarInput". With their corresponding .js and .css files
2- Manipulating the DOM with js and not adding the html tags on my html file. Therefore creating most of the elements with js.
3- Using flexbox and grid to make the website responsive.
4- Manipulating Unsplash's API to learn and practice async, fetch, catch, .then, json, etc.
5- My main functions are fetchImages, displayImages, handleSearch, setupSearchListeners, carga infinita, carga inicial.
a) fetchImages obtains the images from Unsplash.
b) displayImages shows the images on the gallery.
c) handleSearch handles the search.
d) setupSearchListeners adds events for the search.
e) carga infinita adds more images when scrolling.
f) carga inicial obtains images when opening the website.
